# Theme introduction

Kristify uses the [Basalt Framework](https://basalt.madefor.cc), making it possible to **fully customize** your shop!

Kristify comes with its default theme *(kristify-default)*. Other verified themes can be found in the [corresponding repo](https://github.com/Kristify/Themes).
To install a verified theme, enter the following command: `kristify.lua --theme <name>`.

Another common theme would be [kristify-compact](https://github.com/Kristify/Themes/tree/main/kristify-compact).
So let's say you want to install that, then you would type `kristify.lua --theme kristify-compact`.

If all those themes are nothing for you, that is fine too! In the next pages, we will explain how you make your own theme.
