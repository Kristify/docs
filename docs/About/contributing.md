We love help in the aspect of code! This is based around Git and GitHub. There are tons of tutorials out there.

Documentation is very important for any good project. We may not always be good at writing documentation, and your help to change this is welcome!
This is also based around on GitHub. (See repo [kristify/kristify.github.io](https://github.com/Kristify/kristify.github.io/))
