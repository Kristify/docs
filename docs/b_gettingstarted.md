# Getting started

To get started, ru the following command on an Advanced PC or Turtle:

```shell
wget run https://kristify.madefor.cc/installer.lua
```
  
This should open a GUI and guide you through the installing progress of Kristify.  
> ðŸ‘‰ Note: If you get the error `..Forbidden..`, the reason for that could be because of GitHub's rate limiting. If this is the case, **wait for about 1h or hope you play on a server that provides a git token.**

After the installation is done, you still need to setup a few things:  
1. Setup physical stuff *(description below)*  
2. Configuration *(See [docs](https://kristify.madefor.cc/d_configuration/))*  
3. Add products *(See [docs](https://kristify.madefor.cc/e_product-spec/))*  

Step 1 and 2 will be explained in their corresponding docs page *(see links above)*. The physical part will be explained here.  

You should now have a Advanced PC or Turtle with Kristify installed on it. Great! Now its time to place the following things. Kristify **needs** the following parts:  
* **Monitor** *(Minimum 5x3 large)*  
* **Chests** *(Connect as much as you need)*  
* **Turtle**  

After connecting them to the network, write down which name they have *(e.g. "monitor_0")*.
In addition, you can also connect **speakers** for sound support!  

It doesnt matter how you place all those components. Just make sure they are connected.  
**However**, The PC running Kristify should be **only accessable to the shop owner**, and not the customers!
*Or else bad things can happen!*  
  

This was step 1. Easy, right? After that, head other to the [configuration part](https://kristify.madefor.cc/d_configuration/). You will need to fill in all the data you just gathered (like monitors'n stuff) **and** your Krist wallet's name and key!  
  
If this is done too, you now only need to generate your products in the [**corresponding link here**](https://kristify.madefor.cc/e_product-spec/).  
  
Both the config.lua and products.lua file can be now placed in `<kristify_installation/data/`. And thats it!
